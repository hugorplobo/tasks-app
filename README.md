# tasks-app

A web app for manage tasks

1. Add tasks
2. Fix important things
3. Check what you did
4. Delete what you don't need anymore

## How it works

The app uses the Local Storage to save your tasks in a JSON object, without any backend service

## Remaining features

I'm doing this to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and JS, so I don't plan to implement the remaining features like the descriptions in tasks and the time navigation
